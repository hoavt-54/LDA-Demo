Ambassador Bishop had visited Central Command in August 1990 , where he worked with military experts to update the embassy 's E & E plan . The first notice that an evacuation of the Mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of 1 January , when the top naval commander at Central Command sent a message to his naval operations staff : " Better have <unk> crowd take a look at a <unk> <unk> of Mogadishu ! time / distance to get there from <unk> <unk> area . " Following the ambassador 's 2 January evacuation request , the commander of Central Command ordered Air Force aircraft to the region , the movement of amphibious ships to Mogadishu , and requested United States Special Operations Command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation . 
 The initial plan was to evacuate via Mogadishu International Airport . Soon after the evacuation request , the United States Air Force deployed C @-@ 130 transport planes and an AC @-@ 130 , for gunfire support , to <unk> , Kenya , awaiting clearances to enter Somalia and the ability to safely transfer <unk> from the embassy to the airport . However , the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances . It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command @-@ and @-@ control structure , making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage . Likewise , government troops faced a command @-@ and @-@ control problem ; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines , in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with . Thus , it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible . Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu , but faced the same problems of landing and transit of <unk> to the airport . 
 On 4 January , several incidents , including a couple exchanges of gunfire , suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed <unk> until the USS Guam and USS <unk> arrived with their helicopters and soldiers , at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January . The embassy had just six Marine guards , whose job was limited to protecting the <unk> . Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived . The request was denied , but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning . 
 USS Guam and USS <unk> began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22 : 30 ( 23 : 30 Oman time ) on 2 January . The commander of <unk> Group Two had initially proposed a seven @-@ ship <unk> Task Group , composed of vessels anchored at <unk> Island ( off Oman ) and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation . However , intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf , thus the decision to send two of the closest ships . Although the two vessels were selected by mid @-@ afternoon on 2 January , the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to <unk> caused a delay of eight to ten hours . Guam and <unk> carried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade , including a detachment of CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> helicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the US military — and two squadrons of CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight helicopters . 
 Planning began in earnest as the ships got underway , with a combined command center on Guam . On the morning of 3 January , the task force 's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force ; the request was denied . A warrant officer who had previously served as a Marine Security Guard at the Mogadishu embassy during the mid @-@ 1980s was found . Despite Ambassador Bishop 's planning with Central Command , the task force was provided outdated information . The former <unk> told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior . In fact , the new embassy was located further inland and , after receiving updated information , task force commanders determined that a beach landing , requiring troops to fight their way across the city , was too risky . Initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at 01 : 00 on 7 January . However , in response to indications from Ambassador Bishop that conditions in Mogadishu were deteriorating , planners considered 1 @,@ 050 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 940 km ; 1 @,@ 210 mi ) and , later , 890 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 650 km ; 1 @,@ 020 mi ) flights with the CH @-@ <unk> while the ships were still located in the northern Arabian Sea . The situation in Mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until 5 January .
